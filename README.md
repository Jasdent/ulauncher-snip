# ulauncher-snip
Ulauncher-extension
Gnome snipping is now easy.  
Currently supported options:
- snip an area
- snip whole screen
- snip a focused window: snip window [int delay]

Just a tip, if you write it on your own and put it in the extension folder, it simply not gonna work. Somehow it has to be downloaded from github via ulauncher.
